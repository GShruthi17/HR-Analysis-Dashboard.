Attrition Analysis
- A key operational insight: those who travel rarely but work overtime are leaving at the highest rates, pointing to possible burnout or lack of reward for extra effort.
- Sales sees the highest attrition, especially among female employees, suggesting potential issues with role satisfaction, workload, or work-life balance in that department.
- Employees with Bachelorâ€™s degrees have the highest attrition, while Doctoral degree holders show the most loyaltyâ€”possibly due to specialized roles or limited external opportunities.
- The 25â€“34 age group shows the highest attrition, especially among women, indicating a critical career phase where expectations may shift toward growth, flexibility, or new opportunities.
- While average performers leave most often, top performers remain, suggesting that recognition and growth opportunities are effectively retaining high-value talent.
- Employees with low job satisfaction (level 1 or 2) are significantly more likely to leave, especially in roles like HR, suggesting dissatisfaction is a key driver of attrition in specific departments.
